# Sample Programs

This section provides sample programs built on the subroutines and functions of MLegS, designed to help you quickly develop your own MLegS applications. These examples cover a variety of unbounded physical problems, including scalar diffusion, scalar transport, and incompressible vortical flow simulations, giving you a foundation to create custom solutions tailored to your specific needs.
