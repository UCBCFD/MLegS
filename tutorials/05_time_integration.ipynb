    "This tutorial introduces the built-in time integration schemes available in MLegS. Currently, MLegS supports first-order and second-order time integration methods, providing global accuracy of \\\\( O(\\Delta t) \\\\) and \\\\( O(\\Delta t^2) \\\\), respectively, depending on the time-stepping interval \\\\( \\Delta t \\\\).\n",

    "All time integration schemes in MLegS are either fully explicit (`fefe()` and `abab()`) or semi-implicit (`febe()` and `abcn()`). The semi-implicit schemes help address the numerical stiffness posed by the diffusion term by treating it separately from the advection term, balancing numerical stability and computational efficiency.\n",

    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will solve a simple problem with a known exact solution, allowing us to assess the numerical accuracy of the results. The problem involves the temporal evolution of a 2-dimensional axissymmetric vortex, modeled as a Lamb-Oseen vortex, under non-zero viscous dissipation and assuming incompressible flow. The quantity of interest is vorticity, denoted by \\\\( \\omega \\\\), with the following initial condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\omega (r, t=0) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{r^2}{2}\\right),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is non-dimensionalized by scaling the total circulation (\\\\( \\Gamma \\equiv \\int \\int \\omega \\, dS \\\\)) to unity. The governing equation for this problem is the vorticity equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial t} = {\\rm{VISC}} \\nabla^2 \\omega,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\\\( {\\rm{VISC}} \\\\) is the diffusion coefficient, representing the inverse of the Reynolds number (\\\\( \\Gamma / \\nu \\\\)) for the vortex motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the axisymmetry of the base flow, the advection term (\\\\( u_\\phi \\cdot \\partial \\omega / \\partial \\phi \\\\)) is zero, reducing the governing equation to the scalar diffusion equation. The exact solution for \\\\( \\omega(r, t) \\\\) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\omega(r, t) = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot {\\rm{VISC}} \\cdot t\\right)} \n",
    "\\exp \\left(-\\frac{r^2}{2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot {\\rm{VISC}} \\cdot t\\right)}\\right).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "For more drastic change in the vorticity in a short run, we set \\\\( {\\rm{VISC}} = 0.1 \\\\) (i.e., \\\\( {\\rm{Re}} = 10 \\\\) and see the evolution of the vortex up to \\\\( t = 1 \\\\), with a time stepping interval of \\\\( \\Delta t = 0.0001 \\\\) first.

    "Now in the program, `w` is advanced in time based on the semi-implicit Adams Bashforth-Crank Nicolson (AB-CN) scheme via MLegS's built-in `abcn()` subroutine. In the main iterative section of the program, the time-stepping is implemented as follows:\n",

As the FE-BE scheme can yield the first time step field \\\\( w_{1} \\\\) with the accuracy of \\\\( O( \\Delta t ^2 ) \\\\) given the time step interval of \\\\( \\Delta t \\\\), we consider using Richardson extrapolation to obtain the locally third-order accurate first time step field via:\n",
