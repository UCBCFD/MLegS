Fluid Mech.*, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2023.455)) as spectral basis elements. To achieve this, MLegS pre-calculates these functions with appropriate normalization at each collocation point, which is then pre-loaded into the global spectral transformation kit, `tfm`. This tutorial will guide you through the following steps:\n",
