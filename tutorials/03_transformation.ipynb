    "In this tutorial, you will learn how MLegS converts between the physical representation of a scalar field and its spectral coefficient representation. A scalar field defined in a radially unbounded domain can be expressed either in its original (physical) form in cylindrical coordinates \\\\( (r, \\phi, z) \\\\) at discretized collocation points, referred to as the *physical* space expression, or as a set of spectral basis function coefficients, referred to as the *spectral* space expression. A **backward** spectral transformation refers to obtaining the physical space expression from the spectral one, while a **forward** spectral transformation involves computing the spectral space expression when the physical form of the scalar is known.\n",

    "### Local Data Distribution of `scalar`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "To utilize MPI parallelism in scalar transformations and further operations, such as the Laplacian, global data is decomposed and locally distributed to each MPI processor's memory. MLegS employs an in-house **pencil decomposition** scheme (similar to [Laizet & Li, *Int. J. Numer. Methods Fluids*, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1002/fld.2480)), with the general procedure as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Arrange MPI Workers in a 2-Dimensional Cartesian Coordinate Topology**\n",
    "   - For example, with 6 processors of ranks 0 through 5, the processors are arranged in a 3-by-2 grid and assigned 2-dimensional coordinates: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), and (2, 1).\n",
    "   - This MPI communicator toplogy setup is done during the program initialization stage: see `set_comm_groups()`.\n",
    "2. **Decompose Two Global Array Dimensions for Local Distribution to MPI Workers**\n",
    "   - The first array dimension is divided into 3 parts along processor dimension 1 (i.e., \\[0–2\\], \\*), while the second array dimension is divided into 2 parts along processor dimension 2 (\\*, \\[0–1\\]).\n",
    "3. **Retain One Array Dimension Residing Locally in Every Processor**\n",
    "   - The remaining array dimension is not decomposed and fully resides locally in every processor, allowing spectral transformations and operations to be performed along this dimension.\n",
    "4. **Redistribute Local Array Dimensions as Needed**\n",
    "   - When a different array dimension needs to reside locally, the MPI workers exchange data with each other to redistribute the arrays, ensuring the required dimension is locally available for operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second parameter in `s%init()`, consisting of the ordered integers 0, 1, and 2, determines which array dimension initially resides locally in MPI processors and how the other two dimensions are distributed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first, second, and third entries correspond to the radial (first), azimuthal (second), and axial (third) dimensions of the scalar data array `s%e(:,:,:)`, respectively.\n",
    "- For each entry:\n",
    "  - Integer 0: Indicates that the corresponding array dimension is not decomposed and fully resides locally.\n",
    "  - Integer 1: Indicates that the corresponding array dimension is decomposed along Cartesian processor dimension 1.\n",
    "  - Integer 2: Indicates that the corresponding array dimension is decomposed along Cartesian processor dimension 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in the above scalar initialization, the second parameter input of `(/ 0, 1, 2 /)`, assigned to `s%axis_comm`, places the radial (first) dimension of the scalar array locally in every processor, while the azimuthal (second) and axial (third) dimensions are decomposed along Cartesian processor dimensions 1 and 2, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decomposition scheme, applied during the preceding initialization stages, is executed by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "! ... declaration block\n",
    "integer(i4), dimension(3) :: glb_sz\n",
    "complex(p8), dimension(:,:,:), allocatable :: array_glb\n",
    "type(scalar) :: s\n",
    "\n",
    "! ... after the spectral transformation kit (tfm) initialization\n",
    "glb_sz = (/ tfm%nrdim, tfm%npdim, tfm%nzdim /)\n",
    "call s%init(glb_sz, (/ 0, 1, 2 /)); s%space = 'FFF'\n",
    "\n",
    "allocate(array_glb(glb_sz(1), glb_sz(2), glb_sz(3))\n",
    "array_glb = 0.D0 + iu*0.D0\n",
    "! /* assign spectral coeff. values to glb_sz /* !\n",
    "\n",
    "! Here, s%disassemble() performs the pencil decomposition\n",
    "call s%disassemble(array_glb);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Slab Decomposition for 2-Dimensional Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach also supports a **slab decomposition** scheme for 2-dimensional data cases (i.e., \\\\( NZ = 1 \\\\)), by setting the processor topology as (# of MPI processors)-by-1 and assigning the array’s third dimension (of size 1) to Cartesian processor dimension 2 (of size 1, as well), which *de facto* does nothing. This tutorial's accompanying Fortran programs, `backward_trans` and `forward_trans`, actually use this approach as they deal with 2D data."
