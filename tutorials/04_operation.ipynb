    "# MLegS Tutorial 04: Spectral Operation\n",
    "*Disclaimer: This MLegS tutorial assumes a Linux or other Unix-based environment that supports bash terminal commands. If you are using Windows, consider installing the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).*\n",

    "In this tutorial, you will apply a differentiation operation to a scalar field in spectral space. Spectral space operations that convert one set of spectral coefficients to another generally provide more accurate results than physical space operations, such as finite differences or other collocation point-based methods. Many differentiation operations can be performed directly within the spectral space, especially for linear operations like the Laplacian \\\\( \\nabla^2 \\equiv \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\phi^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} \\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "MLegS, in its most recent version, provides essential spectral operations commonly used in physical simulations, like the Laplacian \\\\( \\nabla^2 \\\\), the radial derivative operator \\\\( r \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\\\), and the Helmholtz operator \\\\( \\nabla^2 + \\alpha I \\\\), along with their inverse operations when inversion is feasible. This tutorial explains how these spectral space operations are implemented, using the Laplacian \\\\( \\nabla^2 \\\\) and its inverse as examples, so that you can learn the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Obtain Laplacian of a Scalar**\n",
    "   - Given a scalar field \\\\(s \\\\), its Laplacian, \\\\( \\nabla^2 s \\\\), is obtainable via the MLegS built-in subroutine `del2()`.\n",
    "   - The operation does not require the scalar's physical form and is directly converted in the spectral space.\n",
    "2. **Get Acquainted with Other Built-In MLegS Spectral Differentiation Operators**\n",
    "   - MLegS provides additional differentiation operators, such as the Helmholtz operator \\\\( \\nabla^2 + \\alpha I \\\\) and the powered Helmholtz operator \\\\( \\nabla^{h} + \\beta \\nabla^2 + \\alpha I \\\\) for \\\\( h = 4, 6, 8 \\\\).\n",
    "   - Their mathematical definitions and typical usage in MLegS are presented.\n",

    "Let's reuse the scalar field information generated in the previous tutorial (Tutorial 02: Scalar Transformation), stored in `[root_dir]/output/dat/scalar_FFF.dat`. If you skipped the previous tutorial, don't worry; the program for this tutorial, `laplacian.f90`, will create it for you if `scalar_FFF.dat` does not already exist.

    "MLegS can quickly compute its Laplacian, \\\\( \\nabla^2 s \\\\), directly in spectral space, without requiring any additional computations to transform the scalar to physical space. Given that `s` is loaded with the spectral coefficient data, you can call the `del2()` function as follows:\n",

    "### How MLegS Treats Constants from Laplacian Inversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the inverse Laplacian of an arbitrary scalar \\\\( s \\\\) is equivalent to finding a solution \\\\( f \\\\) such that \\\\( \\nabla^2 f = s \\\\). The homogeneous form of this problem has two general solutions: \\\\( f_1 = 1 \\\\) and \\\\( f_2 = \\ln(r) \\\\), meaning that any scalar field represented as \\\\( f_a = f_p + C_1 + C_2 \\ln(r) \\\\) is a solution to \\\\( \\nabla^2 f = s \\\\) if \\\\( \\nabla^2 f_p = s \\\\). In other words, the inverse Laplacian does not have a unique solution.\n",

    "MLegS manages these two constants, \\\\( C_1 \\\\) and \\\\( C_2 \\\\), as follows to *specify* one solution among Laplacian inversions:\n",
    "- Since both \\\\( C_1 \\\\) and \\\\( C_2 \\\\) can be arbitrary, MLegS sets \\\\( C_1 = C_2 \\\\) to reduce the degrees of freedom.\n",
    "- Generally, scalars are expected to decay to zero as \\\\( r \\rightarrow \\infty \\\\), so \\\\( C_2 \\\\) is typically set to zero (this is why the internal variable `%ln` in `scalar` is almost always set to zero). Thus, in most cases, \\\\( C_1 = C_2 = 0 \\\\).\n",
    "- In rare cases where an inverted scalar requires a nonzero logarithmic term with a constant `c`, the inversion imposes \\\\( C_2 = c \\\\). The `idel2()` command should then take an additional parameter `ln` as follows:\n",

    "In calculations, the logarithmic term is expressed as \\\\( P_l (r) = \\ln((L^2 + r^2) / 2L^2) \\\\), which serves as a proxy for \\\\( \\ln(r) \\\\) to maintain analyticity at the origin when the logarithmic term is nonzero. This approach ensures that the scalar behaves as \\\\( O(\\ln(r)) \\\\) as \\\\( r \\rightarrow \\infty \\\\), while \\\\( P_l (r) \\\\) asymptotically matches this behavior without disrupting analyticity at the origin. See [Matsushima & Marcus, *J. Comput. Phys.* (1997)](https://doi.org/10.1006/jcph.1997.5804) if one wants to find more details.\n",
