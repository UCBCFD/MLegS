    "### Toroidal-Poloidal (TP) Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "For a solenoidal vector field \\\\( \\mathbf{V}(r, \\phi, z) \\\\), where \\\\( \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{V} = 0 \\\\), the field can be represented using two scalar streamfunctions: the toroidal scalar \\\\( \\psi(r, \\phi, z) \\\\) and the poloidal scalar \\\\( \\chi(r, \\phi, z) \\\\). These scalars can be analytically derived as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\psi = -\\left( \\nabla_\\perp^2 \\right)^{-1} (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V})_z, $$\n",
    "$$ \\chi = -\\left( \\nabla_\\perp^2 \\right)^{-1} V_z, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\\\( \\nabla_\\perp^2 \\\\) is the 2D Laplacian operator. Its inverse can be computed in MLegS using the `idelsqp()` subroutine, along with simple additional steps to handle the multiplication of \\\\( (1-x)^2 \\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reconstructing the vector field components, \\\\( V_r \\\\), \\\\( V_\\phi \\\\), and \\\\( V_z \\\\), from \\\\( \\psi \\\\) and \\\\( \\chi \\\\) is straightforward using the TP decomposition formula [(Lee & Marcus, *J. Fluid Mech.*, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2023.455):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V_r = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\phi} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\chi}{\\partial r \\partial z}, $$\n",
    "$$ V_\\phi = - \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial r} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\chi}{\\partial \\phi \\partial z}, $$\n",
    "$$ V_z = - \\nabla_\\perp^2 \\chi. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the vector field \\\\( \\mathbf{V} \\\\) can be expressed in two equivalent forms: \\\\( (V_r, V_\\phi, V_z) \\\\) or \\\\( (\\psi, \\chi) \\\\). In MLegS, the conversion from the cylindrical vector components (`vr`, `vp`, `vz`) to the toroidal and poloidal scalars (`psi`, `chi`) is performed using the `vec2tp()` subroutine:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",

    "!> psi, chi: Output in the FFF space\n",
    "call vec2tp(vr, vp, vz, psi, chi, tfm) ! tfm is the spectral transformation kit (tfm_kit type) in use\n",
    "! ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the conversion from the toroidal and poloidal scalars back to the vector field components is done using the `tp2vec()` subroutine:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "! ...\n",
    "!> psi, chi: Input in the FFF space\n",

    "! ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the vector components (`vr`, `vp`, `vz`) are defined in the physical space, while the toroidal and poloidal scalars (`psi`, `chi`) are defined in the spectral space. This arrangement is practical since vector components are often more intuitively interpreted in the physical space, whereas many vector differential operations, such as the vector Laplacian \\\\( \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{V} \\\\), are more conveniently performed in the spectral space using the toroidal and poloidal scalars.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we consider a *off-centered* swirling vector field with a Gaussian jet component including an intensity adjustment parameter \\\\( q ( \\ne 0 ) \\\\):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{V}(r', \\phi', z) = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-r'^2)}{r'} \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_\\phi' + \\frac{\\exp (-r'^2)}{q} \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_z, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\\\( (r', \\phi') \\\\) is translated polar coordinate parameters centered at a centerline \\\\( (r, \\phi) = (\\sqrt{2}, \\pi /4) \\\\), or equivalently, \\\\( (x, y) = (1, 1) \\\\). We fix \\\\( q \\\\) to 1. Using the analytical derivation of \\\\( \\psi \\\\) and \\\\( \\chi \\\\) (see above), these scalars can be obtained as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\psi = -\\left( \\nabla_\\perp^2 \\right)^{-1} \\left[ 2 \\exp (- (r \\cos \\phi - 1 )^2 - ( r \\sin \\phi - 1 )^2 ) \\right], $$\n",
    "$$ \\chi = -\\left( \\nabla_\\perp^2 \\right)^{-1} \\left[ \\exp (- (r \\cos \\phi - 1 )^2 - ( r \\sin \\phi - 1 )^2 ) \\right], $$\n",
    "\n",
    "because \\\\( V_z (r) = \\exp (- (r \\cos \\phi - 1 )^2 - ( r \\sin \\phi - 1 )^2 ) \\\\) and \\\\( (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V})_z (r) = 2\\exp (- (r \\cos \\phi - 1 )^2 - ( r \\sin \\phi - 1 )^2 ) \\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational generation steps of \\\\( \\psi \\\\) and \\\\( \\chi \\\\), founded upon the above analytic formula, is described in a program-dependent subroutine `qvort_dist()` of the current tutorial program in `[root_dir]/src/apps/vecfld_reconstruction.f90` and curious users may refer to it. The vector field \\\\( \\mathbf{V} \\\\), if interpreted as a flow velocity field, is often called the \\\\(q\\\\)-vortex model, a dimensionless representation of either Batchelor or Lamb-Oseen vortex model."
