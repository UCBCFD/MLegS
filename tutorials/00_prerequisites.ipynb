    "# MLegS Tutorial 00. Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to prepare your environment to work with the MLegS package. By completing these prerequisites, you will be ready to compile and run main programs that use MLegS. The following steps will be covered:\n",
    "1. Configure a compiler and MPI (Message Passing Interface)\n",
    "  - Ensure you have a compatible compiler installed (e.g., GNU or Intel)\n",
    "  - Set up MPI (Message Passing Interface) on your machine, essential for parallel execution.\n",
    "2. Set up external libraries required to run MLegS\n",
    "  - MLegS relies on certain external libraries for matrix operations, fast Fourier transforms and multi-precision arithmetic.\n",
    "  - Install necessary libraries such as LAPACK, FFTE and FM. You do not need to download them; these external libraries, with the compatibility checked for MLegS, are provided in the `[root_dir]/external/` directory.\n",
    "3. Compile MLegS modules.\n",
    "  - With your compiler, MPI, and external libraries set up, proceed to compile the core MLegS modules.\n",
    "  - Use the provided `Makefile` instructions to compile the modules via one-line commands (e.g., `make mods`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Completing this setup ensures that you’re fully prepared to work with programs that use the MLegS package."

    "1. GNU Fortran compiler `gfortran` <v11.2 or later> with OpenMPI <v4.1 or later>\n",
    "2. Intel OneAPI Fortran compiler `ifx` <v2024.1.0 or later> with accompanying Intel MPI\n",

    "For Intel compilers, download and install the toolkit from [Intel's official download page](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/fortran-compiler.html#gs.hbhvru), selecting the distribution that matches your system. After installation, you need to source the Intel environment script (e.g., `source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh` to set environment variables.\n",

The actual numerical calculations and I/O operations are implemented in submodule files located in `[root_dir]/src/submodules/`.
